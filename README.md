This is a simple program demonstrating the A* pathfinding algorithm.  

**FYI:** You have to install pygame to use it.  

From any cell you can move vertically or horizontally (no diagonal movement).

How it works?
---
You can use the mouse and the keyboard to control the program.

Left mouse button:  
  - Set **START** position  
  - Set **DESTINATION** position (If START is placed.)  
  - Draw **WALLS** - click or hold (If START and DESTINATION are placed.)

Right mouse button:  
  - Reset cell under the cursor.

SPACE Key:  
  - Start the simulation

R Key:  
  - Reset the grid (If simulation is not running.)  

*Note: You can't stop the simulation once it is started, but you can exit from the program if you want.*
